<h1 align="center"> Hey People!</h1> 

I see data as a powerful tool to understand and improve the world around us. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about uncovering insights that shape decisions and drive positive change. My focus is on using data to improve lives—whether by enhancing services, empowering communities, or solving real-world problems.

In my experience, data isn’t just for business—it’s for creating impact. Whether I’m analyzing behavior to improve engagement or developing strategies to support underserved groups, I approach every project with the goal of making a meaningful difference. Data should always serve a larger purpose: creating efficiency, inclusivity, and value.

I’m passionate about connecting data to human outcomes and using it to make smarter, more impactful decisions. I aim to bring data-driven solutions that not only solve problems but also improve lives.

I’m graduating in March 2025 and actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute my skills to a team dedicated to leveraging data for meaningful change and creating solutions that truly impact lives.
